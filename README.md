# vixalien.io (2)

vixalien.io is my personal site, built with JSX (not react), compiled with [explosiv] and hosted on [vercel], but most importantly, built from scratch.

> This site is a rewrite of [dotio], which was built with react and rollup and whatnot, rendering it very unstable and imperformant. By rewriting it in [explosiv], not only was it faster, more performant, but also relatively more stable. And most importantly, the JSX syntax was preserved! Thanks for [kartiknair] for creating [dhow], on which [explosiv] is based! ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²

## installation

> Before running please set the environment variable `URL` or else it wil crash. If deploying locally, you can do that by creating a `.env` file at the root and adding `URL=http://localhost:3000`.

vixalien.io is a custom-made site, yet running is very easy

```bash
npm run build
```

> If all goes well, you will see the generated static site at `_static`. That command also built `js` files and `stylus` files before building with explosiv.

If you want to see the results live, run

```bash
npm run dev
```

The site will go live at [localhost].
