Hello everyone! It's almost the end of the year 2022, and I hope you had a
wonderful year. As we look ahead to 2023, I wish you an even better year ahead!

## Overview

The past year was one of change, with many important events taking place around
the world. Some of these events, such as the February Russian Invasion of
Ukraine and the continued impact of COVID-19, had significant and far-reaching
consequences. Other notable events included the global population reaching 8
billion people and the death of Queen Elizabeth II.

I won't be trying to list every single event that happened this year, but
instead will focus on what happened in my own life and what I learned from it.
I'll also interpret some events that happened and provide my thoughts on what
may happen in the future. This blog post is divided into three sections:
Personal, News, and Development.

## Personal

In this section, I'll share some of the important events that happened for me
this year, and my thoughts and feelings about them.

### Graduating

I graduated from high school in August, and looking back, I realize that I'm
going to miss school. It's not just about the fun and memories, but also about
the people. I've made so many wonderful connections and experiences, and it's
hard to think about moving on and starting a new chapter in my life. I know that
I won't always have the same group of friends and colleagues, and that can be
sad.

### Work

After graduating, I started working at [RWARRI], an NGO that helps people in
poverty and refugees, as a web developer and IT specialist. It's been a
challenging and busy year, with less time for personal pursuits, friends, and
hobbies. But on the positive side, I've met some great people and gained some
valuable experience in a work environment and with socializing.

### Work Travel/Missions

As part of my job at [RWARRI], I've had the opportunity to travel and meet
people in different areas who are facing difficult circumstances. These
experiences have really helped me appreciate how lucky we are, even when we have
very little. It's easy to take our basic needs and comforts for granted, but
seeing firsthand how others struggle to meet their basic needs has made me more
grateful for what I have.

In addition to helping me appreciate what I have, these experiences have also
reminded me of the importance of giving more than I receive. This can be as
simple as volunteering my time or resources to help others, or simply being
there to listen and offer support. As Jesus said:

> It is more blessed to give than to receive. (Acts 20:35)

I've learned that these values are important not just in our personal lives, but
also in our work and relationships with others. At RWARRI, we strive to serve
others with compassion and generosity, and I feel fortunate to be a part of that
mission. If you're interested in learning more about RWARRI and how you can get
involved, you can visit their website [here][rwarri].

### Money

> All is vanity. (Ecclesiastes 1:1)

This verse reminds us that everything is fleeting and temporary, and that we
shouldn't place too much value on material possessions. This is a lesson that
I've learned more deeply this year as I've started working and earning a salary.

While I've never been one to care excessively about money, my work has given me
a greater appreciation for the role that it plays in our lives. It's not just
about being able to afford the things we want, but also about having the
resources to meet our basic needs. Seeing others who struggle to put food on the
table has made me more grateful for the financial security that I have.

At the same time, I've learned to be mindful about how I spend my money. I try
to focus on buying the things that I really need, and save the rest for future
needs. I think the key is to prioritize spending on important things and not get
caught up in materialism.

### University/College

I just received my results for my final exams a few days ago, and I'm happy to
report that I passed. Now, I'm looking forward to the next stage of my education
and considering my options for university or college. I'm hoping to secure a
scholarship and, even more hopefully, study abroad. I know that university will
be a different experience, with more challenges and demands, but I'm excited for
the opportunity to learn and grow.

I'm still in the process of researching and deciding on a major, so if you have
any useful tips or advice, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm open to
hearing from others who have gone through this process and can share their
insights.

### Digital Interactions

In today's world, it's almost impossible to avoid having digital interactions
with others, whether through social media, group chats, or online communities
like Discord or Matrix. While these platforms can be a great way to connect with
others and share ideas, I've also learned that people can be more rude and
vicious online than they would be in real life. This has led me to be more
selective about who I engage with online, and to prioritize building trust and
relationships in person.

That being said, I'm not suggesting that you should abandon your online friends
or delete your social media accounts. But I do think it can be beneficial to
limit your digital interactions and focus on more meaningful activities. It's
easy to get sucked into the endless scroll of social media and waste valuable
time that could be spent on things that are more meaningful and fulfilling. Next
year, consider setting limits on your digital interactions and prioritizing
face-to-face connections.

### Depression

This year, I struggled with depression as a result of work-related stress and
other events in my life. At times, I felt overwhelmed, lost all motivation and
will to live, and struggled with impostor syndrome. These feelings were
compounded by external events that made things worse. As a web developer, my
productivity was severely impacted, and I found it difficult to complete tasks
and contribute to my team.

Depression is a serious issue that can last for years or even a lifetime, and
it's not something that can simply be brushed off or dismissed. Unfortunately,
there are still many people who don't understand or take depression seriously,
and this can make it harder for those who are struggling to get the support and
help they need.

If you're struggling with depression, I encourage you to speak to someone about
it. This could be a friend, family member, therapist, or healthcare
professional. It's important to have someone to talk to and share your feelings
with. For me, speaking out about my depression really helped, and it made a big
difference to know that I wasn't alone. If you ever need someone to talk to,
feel free to reach out to me.

There are also many other resources available to help with depression, including
counseling, therapy, medication, and self-care techniques. It's important to
find the right combination of treatments that work for you and to be proactive
in seeking help. Remember, you don't have to suffer in silence â€“ there is help
and hope available.

### Music

Music has always been an important part of my life, and this year was no
different. I found myself constantly plugged into my earphones or headphones,
listening to music to help me focus and stay motivated while programming or
completing routine tasks. Music has a way of filling in the silence and
providing a sense of calm and therapy, at least for me.

I've also been experimenting with using white noise to help me sleep better. A
friend recommended rain sounds, and I have to say, they work wonders for me. If
you have trouble sleeping, you might want to try incorporating some white noise
into your bedtime routine.

In terms of music genres, I really enjoyed listening to amaPiano this year. I
usually use Spotify, but I'm slowly switching over to YouTube Music. Here's a
playlist with 10 tracks I can recommend easily.

### Hobbies

This year, I discovered a new hobby: cycling. It's been a great activity for me,
not only because it's fun and enjoyable, but also because it helps me stay fit
and explore new places. If you're looking for a new hobby, I highly recommend
giving cycling a try.

In addition to cycling, I've also been listening to a lot of informative
podcasts and reading more this year. While I've enjoyed these activities, I
haven't been able to practice my hobbies as much as I'd like due to work and
other commitments. I'm hoping to have more time for my hobbies next year, and to
find ways to balance work and leisure more effectively.

## News/Opinions

In this section, I want to discuss some of the major events that happened in
2022 and share my (unprofessional) thoughts and opinions on them. Please keep in
mind that some of these topics are sensitive, and I will try to be as neutral as
possible.

### Covid-19

The [COVID-19][covid] pandemic has had a significant impact on the world this
year, and we are finally starting to see some progress in terms of vaccination
efforts and returning to pre-COVID situations. While it's sad to think about all
the time and opportunities that were lost during the pandemic, I'm hopeful that
we are on the path to recovery and normalcy.

### Russian Invasion of Ukraine

In February, [Russia invaded Ukraine][ukraine-invasion] and sparked a conflict
with other Western countries. While Ukraine has been able to resist Russia's
efforts, thanks in part to support from NATO countries, the situation remains
tense and unresolved. It's important to respect the sovereignty of all countries
and to strive for peaceful relations with our neighbors.

One aspect of this conflict that has particularly concerned me is the treatment
of Russian citizens. The war is largely being orchestrated by Putin and his
allies, rather than the average Russian person. It's wrong to view all Russians
as enemies and to discriminate against them, especially in fields like software
development where Russian developers have faced job loss and account
suspensions.

In my opinion, unity is always preferable to conflict, and war should be avoided
at all costs. It's important to remember that ordinary people on both sides are
affected by these conflicts, and we should strive for peaceful resolutions
whenever possible.

### Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter

In 2022, Elon Musk made headlines when [he acquired Twitter for $44
billion][twitter-aquisiton]. This acquisition has had a significant impact on
the social media platform and on the world at large. Musk has claimed that there
were shady deals happening with the leadership of Twitter and the US government,
and he has fired a significant number of employees (from around 7,500 to around
2,900).

The mass layoffs at Twitter have had a domino effect, with other companies
following suit and also reducing their workforce. This has led to a decrease in
demand for software development jobs and has caused many people to question if
it's still a viable career path.

It's important to remember that these changes at Twitter and other companies
have far-reaching consequences, and they can have a significant impact on the
employment prospects of individuals in the tech industry. It's always a good
idea to stay informed about developments in your field and to be proactive in
building a strong career.

### AI

![Mechanical dove created with Midjourney V4](/images/posts/2022/midjourney.webp "By Deviationsz1 - Own work, Public Domain --- https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=125105397")

This year, OpenAI released [ChatGPT], an AI system that can engage in real-time
conversation and provide almost-perfect answers to any question you ask. While
this technology is impressive and has raised questions about the future of
humanity and the potential dominance of AI, it's important to remember that it's
still in its early stages and has limitations. For now, ChatGPT is available for
free, but it's unclear how long that will remain the case.

OpenAI also released [DALL-E 2][dalle2], a deep learning model that can generate
digital images based on natural language descriptions or "prompts." This model
and others like it, such as [Stable Diffusion][stable-diffusion] and
[Midjourney], demonstrate the increasing power and capabilities of AI. However,
the use of AI for image generation has also sparked a movement among artists who
feel that their work has been used without their consent. This has led to a
global conversation about the ethical implications of AI art and the need for
consent and proper attribution.

## Development

![Github graph showing my contributions](/images/posts/2022/contributions.webp)

![Github graph showing the type of my contributions](/images/posts/2022/contributions-type.webp)

In this section, I want to share some of my thoughts and experiences as a web
developer. This year, I've been interested in Linux systems, particularly
[GNOME] and [GTK], and have been exploring alternative technologies and
approaches.

### Contributions

This year, I discovered many open source libraries that I really enjoyed,
especially those that I have used in my own projects. The scope of these
libraries is quite broad, but some of the ones that stand out to me include:

- [Rabbet], a small link aggregator that I developed (similar to Linktr.ee)
- [Deno], an alternative runtime to Node.JS
- [Libvips], an image processing library

It's worth noting that, as a developer, it's often common to contribute to these
types of libraries, especially if you rely on them in your daily work.

### New Technology/Skills

I am in the process of rewriting a small link aggregator I made, [Rabbet] using
Deno and hope it'll be ready early next year.

I also started using new software/alternatives:

- [Gitlab] instead of Github (mainly for GNOME-related contributions)
- [Notion] for note-taking, finance management, and more
- [Supabase], an open source alternative to Firebase
- [Linux], specifically [Arch Linux][arch] as an alternative to Windows
- [Mastodon], an open source alternative to Twitter
- and more I probably forgot...

### Deno

One technology that I've been particularly excited about is [Deno], a runtime
for JavaScript and TypeScript that is an alternative to [Node.JS][node]. I've
had a chance to work with Deno this year and have really enjoyed it. In fact, I
even used Deno to [rewrite my blog](/blog/deno-blog). Deno has matured
significantly in recent years, and I think it has a bright future ahead of it.
I've also attempted to create Deno bindings for
[GObject](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject/), a library for creating and using
GObjects, which are used to create object-oriented code in C, with the goal of
allowing GTK programs to be written with Deno. This project is called
[Geno](#geno).

### GNOME Mobile

In the third quarter of this year, I lost my phone and had to purchase a new
one. I was struck by the limited options available: it's either Android or
iPhone. I believe that
[GNOME Mobile](https://blogs.gnome.org/shell-dev/2022/09/09/gnome-shell-on-mobile-an-update/),
a mobile operating system based on Linux, could bring significant improvements
and potentially challenge the dominant players in the market. There are other
Linux-based mobile OSes such as [Plasma Mobile](https://www.plasma-mobile.org/),
[sxmo](https://sxmo.org/), and others, but GNOME Mobile particularly caught my
attention. I hope that it becomes a viable option in the future.

### Developing with GTK

In addition to working with Deno and GObjects, I've also started learning to
make GTK apps (using [Vala], with the goal of learning
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in the future). It's been an interesting
journey, but one that has had its challenges, particularly the lack of good
documentation. However, efforts are underway to improve the documentation, and I
hope that it will become less of an issue in the near future.

### Geno

[Geno] is a project I started to create GObject bindings for Deno. It is still
in the early stages, but I hope to complete it soon and potentially create a GTK
app with it.

### Linux and the Community

I have been using [GNU]/[Linux] for some time now and have grown to really
appreciate it. One of the best things about it is the community of people who
share a passion for GNU/Linux. Many of the people who work on projects such as
[GNU], [Linux], [KDE], [Fedora], [Arch], and others related to GNU/Linux are not
paid for their efforts. They do it because they are passionate about it and I
think that is truly amazing.

In addition to the strong sense of community in the GNU/Linux world, it is also
important to address the issue of mental health. If you are struggling with
depression, it can be helpful to seek support from friends, family, or a mental
health professional. There are also online resources and support groups
available that can provide a sense of community and assistance during difficult
times. It is important to remember that you are not alone and that help is
available.

## Closing

In conclusion, it is clear that the year 2022 has been a year of significant
events and challenges, both globally and personally. From the impact of COVID-19
and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, to the release of powerful AI systems and
the emergence of new technologies, it has been a year of change and adaptation.
As we move into 2023, it will be important to continue learning and growing, and
to prioritize the things that truly matter in our lives.

I finally wish you all a Merry Christmas and Happy new year!
